# Challege Summary questions and answers are below.

# How is the distric summary affected when reading and math scores are dropped for 9th graders at Thomas High School?
   The % Passing Math dropped from 94% to 88%
   The % Passing Reading dropped from 97% to 91%
  The overall % Passing Percentage dropped from 95% to 90 % for Medium Sized schools

# How is the Thomas HS school summary affected?
  THS drops from 4th in Overall Passing %, 95.3% to last place at 68.3%
	Average Math and Reading cores remained nearly identical (83.4, 83.8) before the exclusions and (83.4, 83.9) after exclusions.
	% Passing Math dropped from 93.3% to 66.9%
	% Passing Reading dropped from 97.3% to 69.7%
	So overall, the THS averages are about the same, but a large enough pool of students was removed that the overall percentages went down dramatically when factoring the excluded students.
    

# Affect on Math and Reading scores by removing Grade9 for THS
  Since there is no longer and math and reading score data for THS, we get nan, or nothing, for Average Math and Reading Scores.

# Scores by School Spending

What stands out is change in the $630-644 binn, where % Passing Math, % Passing Reading and % Overall Passing all drop due to the exclusions. This tells us that THS is in the third quartile, or third bin, with respect to Spending Per Student. The scores dropped from %73%, 77% and 72% to 67%, 77% and 72%

# Scores by School Size

The scores for the medium sized schools dropped, again indicating this is the binn for Johnson High School. The % Passing Math dropped from 94% to 88%. The % Passing Reading dropped from 97% to 91%, and the overall % Passing Percentage dropped from 95% to 90 % for Medium Sized schools.
